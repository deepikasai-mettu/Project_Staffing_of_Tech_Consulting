# Project Staffing of Tech Consulting

There are over half a million tech consulting businesses in the United States, who staff over 3 million people in the US and more in offshore sites across the world. Staffing these people to correct projects based on their skill sets, certifications and project experience is a huge staffing HR responsibility and most times, employees just continue to work on the same projects and make their skills redundant. This project aims to provide a DBMS that facilitates efficient and accurate resource allocation.
